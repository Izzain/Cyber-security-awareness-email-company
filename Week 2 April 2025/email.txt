🚨 Would YOU Fall For This Email? Stop, Look, Think. 🔍

Hey all,

Cybercriminals are getting craftier and now they’re using real names, real roles, and real urgency to reel you in.

Take a peek at the example below 👇
It looks legit… but is it? Let’s break it down:

📌 Familiar subject line – Does it sounds like something you’d get every day?
📌 Known sender – But check the address: admlnistrator2@handalindah.com.my ← see the sneaky typo?
📌 Urgent action – “You must respond TODAY” = classic phishing bait.

Stop. Look. Think.
✅ Hover over links.
✅ Confirm sender emails (one wrong letter can mean big trouble).
✅ If it feels “off,” it probably is.

Attached is a quick visual reminder. Share it, post it, or make it your screen saver. Let’s stay sharp and outsmart the phish! 💡🐠
